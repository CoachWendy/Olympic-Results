![Age at First Olympics] (https://public.tableau.com/views/AgeatFistOlympics/AgeatFirstOlympics?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

### Background:
As a gymnastics coach I have always worried about the impact that the sport can have on young women. I have been particularly interested in the amount of time that these young people spend in the gym and what it can do to their social and emotional health. 

### Task:
I recently read an article titled "Time For The End Of The Teen Gymnast" that was sent to me by a parent. It made me curious where the current trends were for gymnasts at their first Olympics.

### Objectives:
What is the trend in ages was between Olympic Athletes in the sport of gymnastics and the difference between male and female athletes. 

### Tools: 
I used RStudio to clean my data and Tableau Public to create my visualization.


I hope to be able to do some more research on this subject in the future.
